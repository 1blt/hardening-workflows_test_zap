## Review Checklist

### 1. Code Review

#### Workflow Files

  - Input parameters are well-defined
  - Secrets handling is secure
  - Error handling is appropriate
  - Timeout values are reasonable

- [ ] Review integration in `reusable-security-hardening.yml`

  - Conditional logic is correct
  - Parameters are passed correctly

- [ ] Review `pr-reusable-security-hardening.yml`
  - Same functionality as main workflow
  - No PR-specific issues

#### Scripts
- [ ] Review `.github/scripts/generate-zap-summary.sh`
  - Correctly parses ZAP output
  - Generates valid markdown
  - Handles edge cases

- [ ] Review `.github/scripts/parse-zap-results.sh`
  - Threshold logic is correct
  - Severity mapping is accurate
  - Exit codes are appropriate

#### Documentation
- [ ] Review `docs/scanners.md`
  - Complete ZAP documentation
  - Examples are correct
  - All parameters documented

- [ ] Review `README.md` changes
  - Scanner table updated
  - ZAP marked as opt-in
  - Links are valid

### 2. Functional Testing

Run the test workflows in this repository:

```bash
# Test all scan modes
gh workflow run test-zap-url-mode.yml
gh workflow run test-zap-docker-juiceshop.yml
gh workflow run test-zap-docker-dvwa.yml
gh workflow run test-zap-compose-mode.yml

# Test thresholds
gh workflow run test-zap-thresholds.yml

# Test integration
gh workflow run test-zap-integration.yml
```

#### Verify Results
- [ ] All workflows complete (check with `gh run list`)
- [ ] Reports are generated for each workflow
- [ ] Expected vulnerabilities are detected
- [ ] Threshold logic works correctly

### 3. Validation Testing

For each successful test run:

```bash
# Download artifacts
gh run download <run-id>

# Validate results
.github/scripts/validate-zap-results.sh \
  path/to/zap-report.json \
  .github/scripts/expected-vulnerabilities-juiceshop.txt
```

#### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Juice Shop scan finds known vulnerabilities
- [ ] DVWA scan finds XSS and SQLi
- [ ] Testfire scan finds documented issues
- [ ] Podinfo scan has minimal findings
- [ ] Reports include CWE classifications
- [ ] Severity levels are correct

### 4. Integration Verification

#### ZAP is Opt-In
```bash
# This should NOT run ZAP
gh workflow run test-zap-integration.yml --field test=opt-in
```
- [ ] Verify ZAP job does not appear in workflow
- [ ] Only SAST scanners run

#### Works with Other Scanners
```bash
# This should run Trivy + Semgrep + ZAP
gh workflow run test-zap-integration.yml --field test=with-other-scanners
```
- [ ] All three scanners complete
- [ ] Separate reports generated
- [ ] No resource conflicts
- [ ] Combined summary includes all results

### 5. Threshold Testing

Review the threshold test results:

- [ ] `threshold=none` passes with findings
- [ ] `threshold=informational` fails on any finding
- [ ] `threshold=low` fails on low+ severity
- [ ] `threshold=medium` fails on medium+ severity
- [ ] `threshold=high` fails only on high severity

### 6. Documentation Review

#### Completeness
- [ ] All input parameters documented
- [ ] All scan modes explained
- [ ] All scan types described
- [ ] Threshold options documented
- [ ] Examples provided for each mode

#### Accuracy
- [ ] Examples are correct and runnable
- [ ] Parameter descriptions match implementation
- [ ] Links work
- [ ] Images/diagrams are clear (if present)

### 7. Security Review

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in workflows
- [ ] Secrets are passed via `secrets: inherit` or explicit passing
- [ ] Docker images are from trusted sources
- [ ] No arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities
- [ ] Scan reports don't expose sensitive data
- [ ] Proper permissions set (principle of least privilege)

### 8. Performance Review

Review workflow execution times:

- [ ] Baseline scans complete in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Full scans complete in reasonable time (< 30 minutes)
- [ ] No timeout issues
- [ ] Container cleanup happens properly

### 9. Error Handling Review

Test error scenarios:

- [ ] Invalid URL produces clear error
- [ ] Missing required parameters fail fast
- [ ] Container startup failures are handled
- [ ] Malformed config files produce clear errors
- [ ] Network issues are handled gracefully

### 10. Regression Testing

- [ ] Existing scanners still work
- [ ] No breaking changes to workflow API
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Default behavior unchanged

## Using the Test Checklist CSV

1. Open `test-checklist.csv` in your spreadsheet tool
2. Work through each test systematically
3. Mark status as:
   - `PASS` - Test passed as expected
   - `FAIL` - Test failed
   - `SKIP` - Test not applicable/skipped
   - `BLOCKED` - Cannot test due to dependency
4. Add notes in additional column for failures
5. Calculate pass rate: (PASS / TOTAL) * 100

## Approval Criteria

The PR should be approved if:

- ✅ All functional tests pass
- ✅ Known vulnerabilities are detected
- ✅ Threshold logic works correctly
- ✅ ZAP is opt-in (not in 'all')
- ✅ No regression in existing scanners
- ✅ Documentation is complete and accurate
- ✅ Security review passes
- ✅ No critical issues identified

## Common Issues and Solutions

### ZAP Reports No Vulnerabilities
**Solution:** Check target application logs to ensure ZAP actually connected. Verify port mappings and network configuration.

### Workflow Fails on Container Startup
**Solution:** Check Docker image availability. Verify healthchecks are configured correctly. Increase startup timeout if needed.

### Threshold Not Working
**Solution:** Verify severity parsing in parse-zap-results.sh. Check that ZAP JSON output format matches expectations.

### Integration Test Fails
**Solution:** Verify other scanners are still working. Check for resource conflicts. Review workflow conditional logic.

## Final Review Checklist

Before approving:

- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Manual validation confirms expected behavior
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and approved
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] No breaking changes identified
- [ ] test-checklist.csv shows >90% pass rate
- [ ] Team consensus on approval

## Rejection Criteria

The PR should be rejected or sent back for changes if:

- ❌ Known vulnerabilities are not detected
- ❌ Threshold logic doesn't work
- ❌ ZAP runs when it shouldn't (not opt-in)
